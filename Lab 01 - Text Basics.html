  <h1>Future Trip Plan to Monaco</h1>
  <!-- For the introduction -->
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The second smallest sovereign state in the world at just 2 kilometers squared, Monaco offers an exhilirating and
    unique experience that I would like to enjoy.</p>
  <!-- List of famous attractions -->
  <h2>Famous Attractions</h2>
  <p>The most famous attraction within the country is the Monte Carlo Casino. Built in the mid 1800s,
    it has developed into the heart of the nation. Even for those who cannot enter it, the views alone
    are enough to attract anyone to visit.
    <br><br>
    The harbours and beach also attract many, and are filled with yachts that overlook the Mediterranean
    sea and the sunset.
    <br><br>
    The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is also a worthwhile visit, being one of the largest museums dedicated
    to aquatic life. Some of the noteworthy exhibits are the sharks (some of which can be petted), and the coral reefs.
    <br><br>
    Other than these, the country is filled to the brim with ancient architecture, all of which can be soaked in through
    walks through the country.
  </p>
  <!-- For sports -->
  <h2>Sports</h2>
  <p>
    Due to its size, Monaco is unable to provide large fields for sporting events, but has tennis and paddle courts, as
    well
    as good roads for cycling. However, the most famous sporting event that runs in the country is the annual Monaco
    Grand
    Prix. It is often regarded as the most prestigious race on the Formula 1 calender, and is known for its very narrow
    and
    tight turns.
  </p>
  <!-- For food -->
  <h2>Food</h2>
  <p>
    The national food of Monaco is Barbajuan, an appetizer that is a variety of fritter that is stuffed with ricotta
    cheese
    and Swiss chard. Fillings can differ between onion, rice, leeks, spinach and Swiss chard. <br>
