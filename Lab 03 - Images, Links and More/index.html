  <h1>Future Trip Plan to Monaco</h1>
  
  <!-- For the introduction -->
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>One of the many places I would like to visit in the future is Monaco. Officially labelled as the Principality of Monaco, it is a miniscule country on the southern side of France, bordering the Mediterranean Sea. With a size of just 2 kilometers squared, the nation holds the title of the second smallest sovereign state in the world, beaten only by Vatican City. Despite its small size, Monaco houses 40,000 people, making it the most densely populated nation in the world. Additionally, it still manages to offer an exhilirating and unique experience through its stunning architecture and views, food and sporting events. For these reasons, I believe I would greatly enjoy a trip to Monaco.</p>

  <h2>Famous Attractions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> The most famous attraction within the country is the <b>Monte Carlo Casino.</b> Built in the mid 1800s, it has developed into the heart of the nation. Even for those who cannot enter it, the views alone are enough to attract anyone to visit. </li> 
    <br>
    <li> The harbours and beach also attract many, and are filled with yachts that overlook the Mediterranean sea and the sunset. </li> 
    <br>
    <li> The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is also a worthwhile visit, being one of the largest museums dedicated to aquatic life. Some of the noteworthy exhibits are the sharks (some of which can be petted), and the coral
      reefs. </li>
